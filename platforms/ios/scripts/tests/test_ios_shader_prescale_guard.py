"""A bundled shader must not divide by an unguarded integer prescale.

Several slang shaders derive a whole-number prescale from output height over source
height and then divide by it. That is safe in RetroArch, where the source is always a
small console framebuffer being scaled up. PCSX2 renders internally at up to 8x, so
above roughly 1.5x the source is taller than the screen, the ratio falls under one,
floor() returns zero and the frame turns black. Reported on an iPhone SE 2 at 2x,
reproduced in the simulator at 3x.

The guard is a max(..., 1.0) around the prescale, which sharp-bilinear-simple and
crt-geom already carry upstream. This test exists because re-syncing a preset from
upstream would silently drop it again.
