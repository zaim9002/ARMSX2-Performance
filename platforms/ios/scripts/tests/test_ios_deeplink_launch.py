"""A launch link's filename is decoded once, and the link's shape is the published one.

`queryValue` returns a value that is already percent-decoded on both of its paths. Decoding
it a second time reads a literal % in the filename as the start of a new escape: `100%.iso`
percent-encodes to `100%25.iso`, the first decode gives `100%.iso`, and the second sees `%`
followed by `.i`, which is not hex, so `removingPercentEncoding` returns nil and the whole
guard fails. The player is then told the link is missing a filename it plainly carries.

The rest of this file pins the format the app publishes for itself. `libraryPayload` and the
game menu's Copy Launch Link hand out a `launchURL` that other frontends store and replay
later, so the verbs and the parameter names are a contract with software this repository
does not control.
