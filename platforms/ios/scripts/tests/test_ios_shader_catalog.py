"""The catalogue downloader's order of operations, asserted against the real source.

Everything this file checks is about ORDER, because order is the whole safety argument.
The manifest is remote and therefore hostile: it states a size and a hash, and the only
reason to trust the bytes is that both were checked before anything was written. A check
that runs after the write is not a check, it is a log line.

Each assertion below is written against character offsets in the real file rather than
against the presence of a symbol. A fence that asserts a function exists passes for a
function that does nothing, which is how three of this phase's other fences turned out to
be decoration.
