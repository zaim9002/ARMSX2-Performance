# ARMSX2 Play Store AAB (come.nanodata.armsx2) — dual-core (4k + 16k page size),
# PGO=optimize, "play" flavor (SAF-only, NO MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE).
#
# Dual-core trick for an AAB: an app bundle can't be built twice, so we
#   (1) assemblePlayRelease with the 16k core, extract its .so, stage it into
#       src/main/jniLibs/arm64-v8a, then
#   (2) bundlePlayRelease with the 4k core; AGP merges the CMake-built 4k .so
#       with the staged 16k .so into one bundle carrying both.
# The bundle is signed with the playRelease config (from armsx2_keystore.properties);
# Play re-signs with the app signing key on its side, so NO rotation lineage here.
#
# SECRETS: signing comes from armsx2_keystore.properties (gitignored). Nothing
# secret is hardcoded.
#
# Usage:  VC=<versionCode> VN=<versionName> tools/build-play-aab.sh [output.aab]
# Env:    PROF (default ~/Downloads/armsx2.profdata), PKG (default come.nanodata.armsx2)
#         PGO_MODE (default optimize; none|generate|optimize) — matches the sibling
#         build-release-apk.sh. This was hardcoded to "optimize", so a caller asking
#         for a profile-free build got one silently built against the profile anyway,
#         and only the core .so size gave it away.
