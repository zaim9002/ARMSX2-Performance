// Discord Social SDK bridge: rich presence, and which friends are in ARMSX2 right now.
//
// DELIBERATELY FREE-STANDING. This file includes no PCSX2 header and links against no PCSX2 code:
// only JNI and the Discord SDK. That is a licensing constraint, not a style preference — ARMSX2 is
// GPL-3.0+ and the Social SDK is proprietary, so the two must not become one linked program. This
// builds into its own libarmsx2_discord.so, loaded only in the :discord process; emucore has no
// DT_NEEDED on the SDK and never loads it.
//
// If you are tempted to call Host::AddOSDMessage or anything else from the emulator here: don't.
// Send a message to the app process and let it do that.
//
// Shape of this file, and why:
//
// Kotlin POLLS this, rather than the bridge calling up into Java. The SDK fires its callbacks on
// its own threads, so pushing would mean AttachCurrentThread plus a global ref whose lifetime has
// to outlive both the Activity and the SDK — for a feature the SDK itself only runs while the app
// is foregrounded. Polling a snapshot behind a mutex has none of that, and "once a second while a
// screen is open" is not a budget worth optimising.
//
// Everything is behind ARMSX2_HAS_DISCORD. A tree without the SDK staged still builds; every entry
// point below has a stub that reports "unavailable", so the Kotlin side needs no build-flavour
// awareness at all.
