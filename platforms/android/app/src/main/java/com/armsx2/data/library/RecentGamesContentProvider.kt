/**
 * Exposes the recently-played list over Binder IPC instead of only the
 * `recent_games.json` file [GameLibraryRepository] writes to systemDirPosix().
 * That path resolves to Android/data/<pkg>/files/ on the volume-choice model
 * (the one folder writable without extra permissions under scoped storage),
 * which the OS blocks from cross-app filesystem reads regardless of storage
 * permission grants. A ContentProvider sidesteps that: it runs in-process,
 * reads its own private SharedPreferences normally, and serves the data out
 * over IPC, no storage permissions needed on either side.
 *
 * Reads SharedPreferences directly rather than going through
 * [GameLibraryRepository]/MainActivityRuntime.prefs, which is only
 * initialized once the main activity has launched; a query from a companion
 * app before that point would otherwise crash or return nothing.
 *
 * Feature contributed by misantronic (PR #566); the opt-in gate in [query] was
 * added on merge.
