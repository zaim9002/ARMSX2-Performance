/**
 * Discord rich presence, and which friends are in ARMSX2 right now.
 *
 * Discord carries the entire social graph — the friendships, the online status, and the "is this
 * person in the same game" grouping are all theirs. That is the whole point of doing it this way:
 * no account system, no friend database, no server, and nothing of the user's kept anywhere by us
 * except an OAuth token in this app's own prefs.
 *
 * Foreground only, by construction. The SDK stops when the app does, so friend changes are seen
 * while ARMSX2 is open and not otherwise. Background delivery would mean push infrastructure, which
 * is exactly the cost this design exists to avoid.
 *
 * Opt-in and off by default: it is an account link, so nothing happens until the user asks.
