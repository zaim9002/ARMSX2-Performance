/**
 * Serial + CRC for a disc image, resolved WITHOUT booting it.
 *
 * The CRC used to appear only once a game had been launched, because every consumer read
 * `VMManager::GetCurrentCRC()`, which is set from the booted ELF and zeroed on shutdown. That left
 * the Info tab blank outside a game and made patch installs refuse outright, since the core only
 * loads `<SERIAL>_<CRC>.pnach` — you had to boot a game just to be allowed to install a patch for it.
 *
 * The capability already existed: `NativeApp.getGameTitle(path)` calls `GameList::PopulateEntryFromPath`,
 * which opens the image and computes serial and CRC with no VM at all. It had zero callers. This is
 * the wrapper it needed.
 *
 * **Blocking — never call from the main thread.** It reads the image's boot ELF (roughly 1–10 MB,
 * more for a compressed .chd, which decompresses on the way). Results are memoised per path for the
 * process lifetime; a disc image's identity cannot change without the file changing.
