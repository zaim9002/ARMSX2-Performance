/**
 * Rolling per-card snapshots of the PS2 memory cards, so a card that turns up damaged can be put
 * back the way it was.
 *
 * Nothing today keeps a previous version of a card. A file card is written straight through to
 * disk as the game plays — each save seeks into the live file, merges the new bits into the sector
 * and writes it out again — so the card on storage is always the only card there is. Anything that
 * interrupts a write leaves the real card damaged, and the player finds out when they load.
 *
 * This is not [BackupManager]. That exports everything a reinstall would destroy into one archive
 * the user asks for and chooses a home for; it is a migration tool, it is manual, and restoring a
 * card from it also rolls back every setting changed since. This is automatic, per-card, and
 * silent.
 *
 * **When a snapshot is taken.** Immediately before the emulation thread starts, from
 * `MainActivityRuntime.start()`. At that instant the card file is not open, so the copy cannot
 * catch a half-finished write and there is no thread timing to reason about. It also means the
 * copy holds the card as it stood when the player last finished successfully — if this session is
 * the one that breaks things, the snapshot is clean by construction. The cost is that restoring
 * loses the current session's saves, which is the trade a save-state slot already makes.
 *
 * **The rules that make it useful rather than harmful**, both in [snapshotActiveCards]:
 *
 *  - A card that fails [verify] is never snapshotted. There is nothing worth saving and a rotation
 *    slot to lose. That same check is what detects the user's problem, so it is reported rather
 *    than swallowed.
 *  - [prune] never deletes the newest snapshot that passed verification. Without that rule the
 *    rotation is a shredder: the card breaks, the player relaunches five times trying to work out
 *    why, and every good copy has been overwritten with a copy of the broken card.
 *
 * Deliberately written against the Java file APIs rather than the core. The storage memory cards
 * live on is FUSE-emulated on some Android configurations, where libc's file-creation call is
 * denied outright — a problem this tree has hit twice already (see MemoryCardViewModel.create and
 * the CreateDirectoryPath fallback in native-lib.cpp), and worked around both times by doing the
 * work from Java. A snapshot writer in the core would fail silently on exactly the devices that
 * need it most.
 *
 * Feature contributed by bmdhacks (PR #608), alongside the three memory card corruption fixes it
 * is built on.
