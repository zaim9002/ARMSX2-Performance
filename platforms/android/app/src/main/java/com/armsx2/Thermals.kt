/**
 * CPU / GPU / battery temperatures, for the panel's stat tiles.
 *
 * Asked for by two people at once (Cotcho: "temp sensor on applicable device as part of stats
 * OSD... maybe intervals in polling the sensors could help mitigate"; Mike22: "more info from
 * the OSD available on the second screen").
 *
 * Android has no supported API for this. HardwarePropertiesManager exists but is gated behind
 * DEVICE_POWER, which is signature-level, so an app cannot use it. What is left is the thermal
 * sysfs, which is readable without permission on essentially every device but is not a contract:
 * zone COUNT, zone ORDER and zone NAMING are all vendor-specific, and the unit is not fixed
 * either. So this discovers zones once by name, tolerates every failure by simply having no
 * reading, and never claims a value it could not actually read.
 *
 * "Not available on this device" is a normal outcome here, not an error.

     * This was Float.MIN_VALUE, which in Kotlin and Java is the smallest POSITIVE float
     * (1.4e-45), not the most negative one -- that is -Float.MAX_VALUE. So it sailed through the
     * overlay's test as a real reading and printed as "0°". The bug is invisible on any device
     * whose zones all resolve, because the sentinel is then never sent; it shows up exactly on
     * the devices the fallback exists for, e.g. a readable CPU zone and no GPU zone printing
     * "CPU 47° GPU 0°". Caught in ARMSX3 review, not by testing.
