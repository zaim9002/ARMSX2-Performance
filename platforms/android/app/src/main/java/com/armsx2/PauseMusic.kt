/**
 * Music for the in-game pause menu, which is otherwise silent — and people sit in it, browsing
 * settings or reading achievements, for minutes at a time.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT [LibraryMusic] with a different gate. That one refuses to play unless
 * `eState == STOPPED`, which is exactly the opposite of what this needs, and the two have opposite
 * lifetimes: the library track runs for as long as you are in the library, this one for as long as
 * the pause overlay is up. Sharing one player would mean one of them constantly fighting the
 * other's start conditions.
 *
 * No audio focus request and no deference to other playing audio — both would break it. On an
 * overlay pause the game keeps its audio DEVICE open and merely underruns to silence: pauseForOverlay
 * calls setOutputPauseSuppressed(true) so Android does not reclaim an idle low-latency stream and
 * stall the resume (#333). That means AudioManager reports the game's stream as "active" the whole
 * time the menu is up, even though nothing is audible — so an isMusicActive() check (as LibraryMusic
 * uses to stay out of Spotify's way) would make this never play at all. Instead we simply play a
 * second stream over the silent game one, and do not request focus so the game's own stream and its
 * resume are left completely untouched.
