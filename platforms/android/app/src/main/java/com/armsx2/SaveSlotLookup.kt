/**
 * Which save-state slots exist for a game, without the game running.
 *
 * The in-game picker asks the native side (`NativeApp.getGamePathSlot`), which resolves against the
 * *running* VM's serial — so it cannot answer this question from the library, where nothing is
 * booted. This reads the same files off disk instead, using the same layout SaveManagerViewModel
 * walks: `<serial> (title).NN.p2s` under `sstates/` or `savestates/`.
 *
 * Kept deliberately small and blocking. Callers are already on a background dispatcher, and the
 * alternative — threading a ViewModel into the library's long-press menu — is far more machinery
 * than a directory listing deserves.
