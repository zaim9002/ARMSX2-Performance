/**
 * The Discord helper, running in its own process (:discord, see AndroidManifest).
 *
 * Why a whole process for this: ARMSX2 is GPL-3.0+ and the Discord Social SDK is proprietary with
 * no published licence. Linking them into one binary would make the emulator a combined work with a
 * library whose source cannot be supplied. Two programs exchanging messages is a different thing
 * entirely, and the process boundary is what makes it true rather than merely claimed — the SDK is
 * loaded here and nowhere else, and libemucore has no reference to it at all.
 *
 * Everything the SDK does happens on this process's main thread, which is also the thread that
 * creates the client, because the SDK delivers its callbacks only to that thread. The app process
 * polls for state rather than being pushed to, which keeps the protocol one-directional and means
 * a dead helper degrades to "nothing new" instead of a hang.

     * a cached token -- i.e. every launch after the first. It is not specific to signing in: the
     * SDK's statics are per-process and Android restarts :discord whenever it likes, so the
