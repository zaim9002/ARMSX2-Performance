 * Frame-generation stubs. The Play build has no frame generation of any kind — not the section,
 * not its strings, not the native library — so these render nothing and exist only to keep the
 * two shared call sites compiling.
 *
 * The real implementations are in the github source set. Deliberately arranged this way rather
 * than as a runtime flag in a shared file: a flag stops the rows being drawn, it does not stop
 * the code and the text shipping.
