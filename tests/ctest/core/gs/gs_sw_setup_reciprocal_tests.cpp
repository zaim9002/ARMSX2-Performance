// Which reciprocal the triangle setup truncates, and which attributes take it.
//
// The GS does not divide to form an attribute gradient: it multiplies by a
// reciprocal read out of a table eight significant bits wide. That much was
// measured on an SCPH-30001 over twenty-four baselines, but on one triangle
// SHAPE -- flat top, vertical left side, and a height of 1024, a power of two.
// Under that shape the reciprocal of the horizontal baseline and the reciprocal
// of the setup's cross product have the identical mantissa, so the capture could
// not say which quantity the hardware inverts, and neither could anybody reading
// it.
//
// A second capture swept the height alone. The exact gradient does not contain
// the height at all, so the reading needs no model: if the denominator were the
// baseline every height would draw the same row, and if it is the cross product
// the rows move. On the console they move -- up to 340 of 442 readings between
// two heights -- while two heights a power of two apart stay byte-identical, as
// every candidate requires. Across four shape classes the cross product's
// reciprocal explains 93.7% to 96.3% where the exact quotient explains 56% to
// 81%, and the class whose cross product is neither edge's length (a slanted
// left side, W*H - K*P) prefers it just as strongly.
//
// It does NOT apply to everything the setup forms. On the same sweep, at heights
// whose truncated reciprocals would move a sampled texture coordinate by three
// sixteenths of a texel and a depth value by more than a whole pixel step, the
// console's texture coordinates and depth values do not move at all -- and our
// arm, which divides exactly, is 100.00% against silicon on both. Colour and fog
// take the truncated reciprocal; s, t, q and depth take the exact quotient. The
// tests below hold both halves, because a fix that spreads is as wrong as one
// that does not land.
//
// Capture: the gs-shape console capture, SCPH-30001, GS revision 0x15, two
// byte-identical console runs.
//
// The rule lives in GSRasterizer::DrawTriangle, which has an ARM64/SSE4 body and an
// AVX2 twin, so this runs on both hosts: on x86 it is the AVX2 twin that is on trial.
// The gate is multi-ISA, not architecture -- a multi-ISA x86 build compiles the
// rasterizer into isa_sse4/isa_avx/isa_avx2 and has no isa_native at all, so the
// header cannot even be included there. That is every x86 CI configuration today, so
// on x86 this suite only runs in a local build with DISABLE_ADVANCE_SIMD=OFF.
