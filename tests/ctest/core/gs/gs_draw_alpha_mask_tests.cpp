//
// The exact alpha drop clears the alpha byte of FBMSK, which is right for the shader and the
// barrier and wrong for anything asking what the draw asked for. Getting that backwards is not a
// hypothetical: reading the RTA de-correction decision off the cleared flag left a target alpha
// scaled where it used to de-correlate, and moved 41% of the pixels in two of Beyond Good and
// Evil's frames by a unit or two of colour.

// So the cases that matter are the two ends: with nothing dropped the rule has to reproduce the
// live config pair exactly, and with something dropped it has to hand back the byte the drop took
// rather than the zero the config now holds.
//
// Rides gs_vertex_tests -- the rule is header-only constexpr, so it needs no extra linkage.
