// Pins the feedback-loop carry decision (GS/Renderers/Common/GSFeedbackLoopCarryPolicy.h).
//
// The carry keeps a render pass open across a run of draws on one target once one of them has
// declared the pass self-reading, instead of ending the pass to clear the flag for the next
// non-reader. It exists because a tiler pays a full tile store and reload at every pass boundary,
// and on the framebuffer-fetch path the flag costs nothing to leave set.
//
// What these tests are for is the OTHER half: every device that is not on that path must reach
// exactly the behaviour it had before, and there is no way to see that on a desktop GPU, which
// never takes the fetch path at all. So the decision was written as a pure function and the
// no-change cases are pinned here by name.
//
// Rides gs_vertex_tests -- the policy is header-only constexpr, so it needs no extra linkage.
