/*	fpuDouble() and fpuOperandBits() lived here.

	They were the operand model: exponent 0 to signed zero, which is right,
	this FPU has no denormals; and exponent 255 folded to +-0x7F7FFFFF, which
	was the largest single source of divergence from the console in the whole
	capture. On the EE exponent 255 is an ordinary binade: 0x7F800000 is 2^128
	and 0x7FFFFFFF is the largest number there is. Folding those operands
	destroyed information before the op ever ran; 368 of the 1147 captured cases
	touch the top binade.

	The clamp came off the arithmetic first (ccae642180, 4ce2b543cb), which left
	the compares as its last user on the grounds that clamped and unclamped
	compares agree except where both operands are in the top binade. One is
	enough: it only has to collide with an unclamped 0x7F7FFFFF, and four
	captured rows do. See C_cond_S above. The arithmetic reads eeToDouble(),
	which clamps nothing, and rounds once through eeRoundToSingle().

	SQRT_S was the other caller with work to do on exponent 255, and does it
	itself now: eeSqrtBits() works in integers, so nothing has to be clamped to

/*	Round an exact result into the EE encoding. This is the only rounding step
	the arithmetic ops below perform.

	Three things a bare (float) cast does not do:

	  * Saturation is at the EE's maximum, 0x7FFFFFFF, not at FLT_MAX. On
	    silicon, add.s of +2^128 to itself is 2^129, out of range, and comes
	    back 0x7FFFFFFF; add.s of 0x7F7FFFFF to itself is exactly 0x7FFFFFFF and
	    comes back unrounded. Folding either to 0x7F7FFFFF, which is what
	    clampToEeRange did to a host infinity, is a whole binade short.
	  * The top binade has no host single. Anything at or above 2^126 is rounded
	    through a scaled-down copy and its exponent put back afterwards. Scaling
	    by a power of two is exact and leaves the mantissa alone, so the rounding
	    decision is bit-identical to the one the host would have made if float
	    had the range -- the same reason SQRT.S can compute sqrt(|Ft|/4)*2.
	  * Underflowing results are not all flushed; `addsub` picks the rule. See
	    the block below.

	The (float) casts round under the host FPCR, so the EE's rounding mode is
	honoured here without naming it -- including the divide/sqrt unit's separate
	mode, which its callers scope in.
*/
/*	Underflow: a result strictly below 2^-126 and not zero is not always

	signed zero. That is the raw output of an adder with no denormal path:
	`exact` is a double 1.m * 2^E, and what comes out is m's top 23 bits, i.e.
	bits [51:29] of the double, with the exponent thrown away. It is not the

/*	The EE multiplier's one-ULP deficit.

	The console's multiply array is not a correctly-rounding multiplier: it
	comes back exactly one step closer to zero on a large fraction of operands,
	and which operands depends on operand order. Upstream states the rule in a
	comment (the note above FPU_MUL in `pcsx2/x86/iFPU.cpp`) and never tests it;
	FpuMulHack is a one-point sample of it.

	Measured on SCPH-90000 (FCR0 0x2e40), captures/fpmul/ in the session
	archive. Runs 2 and 3 sweep all 2^23 ft significands at each of twelve fs
	significands, 100663296 rows, and every one of them is either exact or one
	ULP low -- nothing ever came back high, or two ULP low:

	  * `mul.s(1.0, x)` was measured for every one of the 2^23 significands.
	    8257536 of them come back one ULP low and 131072 exact.
	  * `mul.s(x, 1.0)` is exact for all 2^23. The asymmetry is total, not
	    statistical: only ft is recoded, so only ft can contribute a negative
	    digit whose correction the truncated columns drop, which is why the
	    operation is not commutative.
	  * Unchanged across twelve exponent-field pairs from (1,254) to (254,1),
	    so it is a significand-domain effect with no exponent term.

	The mechanism: ft is the Booth-recoded operand and the array's low columns
	are not built, so the low partial products arrive at the summation tree
	missing their bottom bits and each low negative digit's two's-complement
	correction is dropped. eeMulArray() reconstructs that truncated low half and
	compares its column 15 against the exact product's. Where the two disagree
	the array lost exactly 2^15 there, and the loss reaches the result only if
	borrowing it crosses the single ULP.

	The reconstruction is not ours. It is the multiplier out of a proposed PCSX2
	soft-float series -- GitHubProUser67, "Core/EE: Implements Soft-Floats for
	the interpreters", 2025-04-20, crediting Gregory Gaines' write-up, the
	PS2FloatLibrary in MultiServer3 and Goatman13's accurate_int_add_sub branch.
	It is unmerged and still moving: PCSX2 master has no PS2Float, and the
	pcsx2-reliquary fork that carries it as pcsx2/PS2Float.inl has revised it
	since. The shape below is that routine, MulMantissa(), with its two small
	structs unpacked. Bit-exact on all 100663296 measured rows, 15283477 of
	them one ULP low.

	What this replaced: on the 15585118 rows whose product is exactly
	representable the decision collapses to a closed form in ft's mantissa alone
	-- one ULP low iff a negative Booth digit appears among digits 0..4
	(`m & 0x2AA`), or bit 11 disagrees with a boundary term on bits 12..15 --
	the same column-15 test specialised to a zero tail. It is exact there and
	short on 58585 of the remaining rows, where the decision needs fs and so no
	predicate over ft can reach it. The arm64 emitters still implement a cut of
	it, which is cheap where this is not; see iFPUd-arm64.cpp.

	The gate below is exact: a borrow of 2^15 crosses a multiple of 2^k only
	where the tail beneath it is already smaller than 2^15. It leaves the array
	running on 0.27% of random operand pairs.

	Applied only where it was measured: a saturating or flushed result, and a
	decrement that would walk the exponent field to zero, are left alone.
