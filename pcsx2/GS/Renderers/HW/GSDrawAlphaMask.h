/// The drop clears the alpha byte of FBMSK when the target already holds those bits at the value
/// this draw would write, so the write lands whole and the shader needs no read-back of the
/// destination. What that changes is the shader and the barrier: after the drop, `ps.fbmask` is
/// off and nothing in the pipeline is merging a destination alpha byte.
///
/// It does not change what the draw asked for. A decision like "does this draw partially mask
/// alpha, so the target must come out of RTA alpha scaling?" is about the draw, and reading it off
/// `ps.fbmask` gets the wrong answer once the drop has cleared that flag -- the target then stays
/// scaled where it used to de-correlate, and the round trip through the scaled representation moves
/// colour by a unit or two. Those decisions ask for AsRequested() instead, which gives back the
/// mask the drop took away.

/// The rule is a header of its own so the distinction is written down once and can be tested
