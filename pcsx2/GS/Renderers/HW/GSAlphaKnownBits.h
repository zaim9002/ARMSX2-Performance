/// bit through a mask. A write that masks bit 7 leaves bit 7 exactly as it was, but min/max has
/// to widen to cover both the old and the new values, so a target written only through a partial
/// alpha mask sits at 0..255 forever. A per-bit (bits, value) pair can still say "bit 7 is zero
/// everywhere" across such a write.
///
/// The pair is a strict refinement of the range, maintained beside it at the same sites. Nothing
/// reads it except the exact FBMSK-drop rule; the range stays authoritative everywhere else.
