// An interpolated depth never quite reaches its plane on silicon.
//
// Measured on an SCPH-30001 with the gs-zgrad probe, which drives integer
// landings under a raw depth readback densely and on purpose. On a gradient of
// 1/4 -- where the 2^-10 step truncation is the identity and our walk is
// otherwise exact -- every fourth pixel of every row read one unit HIGHER than
// the console and nothing between them differed at all. The walk runs short of
// the plane, so a pixel whose exact depth lands on an integer stores the
// integer below it.
//
// The bias is half a step of the 2^-10 grid the step already sits on: large
// enough to move a value that lands exactly on an integer, small enough to
// leave a value even one step above it alone.
//
// The two axes carry the shortfall DIFFERENTLY, which the capture separates
// rather than assumes. Both halves were measured by rebuilding and re-running
// the probe, not reasoned about:
//
//   X  present from the span's first pixel -- a primitive with an X gradient
//      reads one low even at the vertex itself -- and NOT following the
//      gradient's sign. Signing it moved gs-zgrad's gridx section from 192
//      wrong pixels to 384.
//
//   Y  accumulates instead. The vertex scanline is exact on silicon (the pure-Y
//      cases differ only on their first row otherwise), and the shortfall
//      points back toward the seed, so a FALLING gradient runs high. Signing
//      this half took the ygrad section from 448 wrong pixels to zero.
//
// "Has stepped" means stepped off the PRIMITIVE's first scanline, not the
// section's. That is two claims, and the capture reaches exactly one of them.
//
// That the exemption exists at all IS measured: dropping it lights three of
// gs-zgrad's ygrad cases, one top row each. That it keys on the primitive
// rather than on our section split is NOT -- every triangle the probe draws is
// flat-topped and therefore single-section, so the probe is byte-identical
// across that half. It is kept on the reasoning that a triangle without a flat
// edge is walked as two sections rebased on the middle vertex, silicon has no
// such split, and letting the second section's first row take no bias would lay
// a one-unit depth discontinuity along the middle vertex's row -- a seam we
// would have invented. Measuring it needs a subject with three distinct vertex
// Ys and a Y gradient, which nothing we own draws today.
//
// A flat triangle is exact on silicon -- 896 of 896 readings -- so the bias
// belongs to the walk and not to the seed, and a primitive with no depth
// gradient takes none of it. Sprites never come here: their depth is carried as
// an integer and never interpolated.
//
// Applied to the scanline seed rather than tested at the store, so it costs
// nothing per pixel and both scanline backends inherit it from one place.
