// Which host-visible memory the six Vulkan stream rings live in.
//
// The rings -- vertex, index, expand-index, VS uniform, PS uniform, texture upload -- are written
// by the CPU and read by the GPU, and nothing ever reads one back. Until this decision existed,
// VKStreamBuffer::Create asked VMA for HOST_VISIBLE with HOST_COHERENT preferred and took whatever
// came out, which on every Turnip device is memory type 0: the write-combined, uncached type. That
// is not a free choice. An uncached store is only fast if the core's store buffer merges adjacent
// writes into full bursts, and the small in-order-ish cores this emulator targets merge badly.
//
// What the devices said (a keyed corpus round on three parts, 2026-09-03):
//
//   * MQ65 (Adreno 610, Turnip 26.1.2) offers NO cached coherent host-visible type. Moving the
//     rings to the cached NON-coherent type, paying the per-region flush CommitMemory already
//     issues, took GS-thread p50 down 29.5% on legosw, 28.4% on gow2, 21.0% on yugioh and 20.6%
//     on ac5. Draw-heavy controls flat, 24 of 24 frame grids byte-identical.
//   * RG 477V (MT6897, Mali-G615) reports the MQ65's memory table bit for bit and gives the
//     opposite answer: its cached NON-coherent type made every title slower, +2.6% (legosw) to
//     +12.4% (ac5), scaling with the flush count.
//   * SD865 (Adreno 650, same driver) DOES offer a cached coherent type, and it is NOT free. The
//     keyed round (one binary, runtime key on/off) read gt4opb -13.8% against legosw +5.3% and
//     ac5 +3.6%, and the -13.8% was taken as the headline. The keyless confirmation round -- two
//     real binaries, pre-policy 8a836e93b9 against 535200c107, banners verified on every run,
//     n=3 + warm, loop 10 -- reproduced the two regressions and not the win: legosw +6.16% and
//     ac5 +5.54% with non-overlapping rep ranges across three reps, gow2 +3.03% borderline,
//     gt4opb -1.08% inside a 5.98% policy-arm spread. Two losses that replicate under two
//     independent methods, one win that replicates under neither.
//   * The store INSTRUCTION is not the story. Replacing the storent (STNP) copy with memcpy moved
//     nothing anywhere, on any device, with or without the memory-type change.
//
// So: write-combined is the default everywhere, and the driver database's
// PreferCachedStreamRingMemory bit is what grants a cached road at all. Given the bit, the memory
// table picks WHICH cached road: coherent if the device has such a type, non-coherent otherwise.
//
// ⚠️ Neither cached road is a shape the policy may infer. That was the original mistake and it is
// easy to make twice, because each road has an argument for why it should be free. The
// non-coherent road TRADES -- cached stores in exchange for a cache clean per commit -- and
// whether the trade pays is a property of the host's cores and its cache maintenance, not of the
// memory table: the MQ65 and the RG 477V satisfy "has no cached coherent type" identically and
// land 30% apart in opposite directions. The coherent road pays no flush at all, which is why it
// was originally taken without asking, and the SD865 still lost two titles on it reproducibly for
// a reason nobody has named. So the database bit means "measured, on this part, and it won", for
// both roads. A device with a cached coherent type and no rule stays write-combined; the A650 is
// that device today.
//
// ⚠️ Both cached roads require DEVICE_LOCAL, and that requirement is load-bearing on desktop. On a
// discrete GPU a HOST_VISIBLE|HOST_COHERENT|HOST_CACHED type is ordinary system RAM, and moving
// the rings there would send every vertex, index, uniform and texture staging byte across PCIe on
// the GPU's side of the read. Today's HOST_COHERENT-only ask lands on the device-local BAR type
// there, which is the right answer for memory the GPU reads. A device whose only cached
// host-visible types are host-local therefore stays on the write-combined road even with the bit
// set.
//
// Written as a pure function of the memory-type table and one database bit so the roads no device
// on this desk takes can still be pinned. See gs_stream_ring_memory_tests.cpp.
