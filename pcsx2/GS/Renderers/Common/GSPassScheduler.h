/// Holds hardware draws back so that draws to the same render target can be emitted
/// together, as one render pass instead of one pass each.
///
/// This exists for tiling GPUs. On a desktop GPU a render pass boundary is close to free;
/// on Adreno or Mali each one is a full tile load followed by a full tile store, so a game
/// that alternates between two targets pays for the whole framebuffer twice per switch.
/// Dirge of Cerberus is the motivating case: 1234 draws per frame ping-ponging 1:1 between
/// a colour target and a mask target, 822 switches, ~887 render passes, and only 11 draws
/// that actually read across the pair. Keeping a run open per target turns that alternation
/// into two passes, removing both the tile traffic and the per-pass CPU cost the driver
/// charges on the GS thread.
///
/// Correctness rests on two things. Draws within a run keep their order, so same-target
/// results are never affected. Draws in *different* runs are reordered, which is only legal
/// while the runs are independent - so every way one run could observe another is a flush:
/// overlapping attachments, one run sampling what another writes, or one run writing what
/// another sampled.
///
/// The scheduler deliberately knows nothing about GS memory; it works on GSTexture identity
/// and relies on GSDevice::FlushDeferredDraws() being unavoidable, since anything that could
/// observe a target goes through an entry point that flushes first. Layers that know more -
/// the texture cache, which can see two GSTextures aliasing the same GS block range - flush
/// explicitly.
