// Carrying a fixed blend factor (ALPHA.C == 2, AFIX) to the blend unit through the second
// fragment output instead of through the API's blend constant.
//
// There are two hardware expressions of the same number. A fixed factor is a per-draw constant, so
// the natural one is the blend constant: the blend state asks for CONST_COLOR / INV_CONST_COLOR and
// the backend hands the value to vkCmdSetBlendConstants. The other is the second fragment output,
// which the blend unit already reads for the As equations (SRC1_COLOR / INV_SRC1_COLOR); the shader
// writes AFIX/128 there and the factor arrives the same way As does. Both feed the same fixed-
// function multiply, and for AFIX <= 128 both feed it the same value.
//
// Mesa Turnip applies VK_BLEND_FACTOR_ONE_MINUS_CONSTANT_COLOR as if the constant were zero on some
// draws -- the destination survives at full strength instead of at 1/128 -- while honouring
// ONE_MINUS_SRC1_COLOR correctly in the same render pass on the same frame. Katamari Damacy's ball
// is the visible case: every layer accumulates and the ball saturates towards white. The trigger is
// run history, not anything the draw carries, so no emission change reaches it; re-emitting the
// constant before every draw that reads it (17 -> 58 vkCmdSetBlendConstants a frame) moves zero
// pixels. Reproduced on Adreno 650 and 610 (Mesa 26.1.2) and Adreno 740 (26.3.0-devel), with the
// Qualcomm blob correct on the same silicon; the applied factor was solved out of a RenderDoc
// capture over 648 texels and comes out at 1.0 where the state asks for 1/128.
//
// So on a device the driver-bug database marks BrokenBlendConstant, stop asking for the constant and
// send the same number through the second output. That is a pure rewrite of the blend state plus one
// pixel-shader selector bit; it changes HOW the factor reaches the blender and never WHETHER a draw
// is blended in hardware.
//
// Kept here, as pure functions, because the no-change half is the half that matters: every device
// without the bug bit must take byte-identical decisions, and that cannot be observed on the one
// device that takes the changed road.
