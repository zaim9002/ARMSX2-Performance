// Whether a draw that samples the render target it is also writing has to read from a COPY of
// that target instead of from the live attachment.
//
// GSRendererHW::HandleTextureHazards resolves such a draw one of three ways:
//
//   1. tex_is_fb -- the read lands on the pixel the fragment is writing. That is the destination
//      read, and it is what an in-tile read (Vulkan rasterization-order attachment access,
//      GL_ARM_shader_framebuffer_fetch, Metal programmable blending) is FOR.
//   2. a barrier -- the read is a real texture sample of the live attachment, ordered against the
//      draw's own writes by a pipeline barrier.
//   3. a copy -- the source is snapshotted into its own texture first, the render pass ends, and
//      the draw samples the snapshot. Always correct, and the most expensive.
//
// Road 2 has a shortcut: when the rect the draw writes and the rect it reads do not intersect,
// HandleTextureHazards asks for one barrier and skips the copy. On a device with framebuffer
// fetch that shortcut lands the draw with neither. The copy is gated on the backend having no
// texture barrier (GSDeviceVK's draw_rt_clone), which fetch devices do have; and the barrier is
// then dropped by FbFetchDropsDrawBarriers, whose reasoning -- "fetch replaces the destination
// read" -- is about road 1 and says nothing about a sample of a DIFFERENT pixel.
//
// Nothing is left. The draw samples the live colour attachment while it is the pass's colour
// attachment, on a tiler, where the recent writes to the region being read are in tile memory and
// have not resolved. Which of them have resolved by the time the sample executes is the driver's
// scheduling, not program order. Measured on an Anbernic RG 477V (Mali-G615 r44p1) with fetch
// forced on: MGS3 and OutRun 2006 render differently every run, and they are the only two titles
// in the 22-dump corpus that read their own render target at an offset.
//
// So: on a device whose destination read is in-tile, an offset read of the target takes the copy.
//
// There are TWO roads out of the copy that leave a draw reading the target at a location it is not
// writing, and this one decision serves both:
//
//   * the disjoint-rect shortcut described above -- the write rect and the read rect do not
//     intersect, so the draw asks for one barrier and skips the copy;
//   * a channel shuffle whose source page differs from its destination page, which samples the live
//     target at gl_FragCoord + ChannelShuffleOffset and skips the copy the same way.
//
// The remedies differ, because the second addresses its source through a shader-side offset added
// to the fragment's own position: its copy has to be coordinate-identity, so the source region
// lands in the copy where it sits in the target and the shader offset still finds it. That is the
// copy GSDeviceVK's draw_rt_clone already makes for the same draw on every device without a
// texture barrier. The decision -- "does this read need a copy at all" -- is the same question in
// both places, so it is one function and one key.
//
// Note the barrier would not have been enough anyway. The one this road asks for is
// VK_DEPENDENCY_BY_REGION_BIT, and so is the render pass's self-dependency; by-region is
// framebuffer-local, which is the wrong dependency for a read of a different location on any
// tiler. It survives on desktop because immediate-mode drivers over-synchronise it. That is why
// this rule is "take the copy", not "keep the barrier".
//
// Written as a pure function of the device's facts so the no-change cases can be pinned without
// the device that takes the changed one. See gs_self_read_copy_policy_tests.cpp.
//
// This shipped for one round behind EmuCore/GS/FetchOffsetReadCopies so the device suite could run
// both arms off one binary. The round decided it: on the RG 477V, MGS3 and OutRun 2006 are
// run-to-run byte-identical with the copy and reproduce their old every-run-different signature
// without it, and both score closer to the software golden than the copy-path arm. The key is
// gone; the copy is what the function returns.
