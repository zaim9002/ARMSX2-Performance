/// The upstream consumer app captures the screen with MediaProjection and composites over the
/// target process, because Android 12+ forbids injecting code into a non-debuggable app. That
/// constraint is not ours: ARMSX2 owns its swapchain, so we hand the library our own images
/// through its AHardwareBuffer entry points. No screen capture, no overlay, no accessibility
/// service, and the interpolated frames never leave our process.
///
/// NOTHING PROPRIETARY IS BUNDLED. The interpolation shaders are read at runtime out of the
/// user's own legitimately purchased Lossless.dll, which they supply through the Storage Access
/// Framework exactly as they supply a PS2 BIOS. Absent that file the feature stays off.

/// Every entry point is a no-op when ARMSX2_HAS_LSFG is undefined (the play flavour, and any
/// build whose fetch did not produce the library), so call sites need no #ifdef of their own.
