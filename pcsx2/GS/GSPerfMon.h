		// to expose.
		//
		// It exists because ONE of these per frame serializes the whole pipeline: a frame with
		// any of them runs at cpu + gpu, a frame with none at max(cpu, gpu), and the count above
		// one does not matter. So the acceptance metric for readback work is literally "is this
		// zero in steady state", which no other counter can answer -- Readbacks counts copies
		// that reach the device, and a copy is not the same thing as a wait.

		// population `RenderPasses` counts -- same two functions, both directions of the pair -- so
